                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5"><div>Mary Baker Eddy, who discovered and founded Christian Science, defined it as “the law of God, the law of good...” (Rudimental Divine Science). This deeper understanding of God as infinite Love and unchanging goodness leads to prayer that can heal, redeem, and restore anyone. In 1866, a life-threatening injury compelled Mary Baker Eddy to turn wholeheartedly to God. She opened her Bible to an account of Jesus healing a man quickly and completely. A new sense of God, Spirit, as the only reality flooded her thought, and she was healed spontaneously. But she yearned to know how and why. For the next several years, she continued to search and find in the Bible the underlying laws of God  that would form the basis of her teaching and practice of Christian Science. Since then, many have found that when they better understand their relationship to God through this Science of Christianity, their health is restored and character transformed. And each healing inspires a heartfelt desire to help others know and experience how loved we all are by God.When Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, was asked if Christian Scientists had a religious creed, she responded: “They have not, if by that term is meant doctrinal beliefs” (Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, pp. 496–497).&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">She did, however, outline a few brief tenets—or key points—that succinctly summarize the essential points of Christian Science, all of which are rooted in the Bible.<br><br></span></div><div><strong>Tenets of Christian Science
</strong></div><div>As adherents of Truth, we take the inspired Word of the Bible as our sufficient guide to eternal Life.
</div><div>We acknowledge and adore one supreme and infinite God. We acknowledge His Son, one Christ; the Holy Ghost or divine Comforter; and man in God's image and likeness.
</div><div>We acknowledge God's forgiveness of sin in the destruction of sin and the spiritual understanding that casts out evil as unreal. But the belief in sin is punished so long as the belief lasts.
</div><div>We acknowledge Jesus' atonement as the evidence of divine, efficacious Love, unfolding man's unity with God through Christ Jesus the Way-shower; and we acknowledge that man is saved through Christ, through Truth, Life, and Love as demonstrated by the Galilean Prophet in healing the sick and overcoming sin and death.
</div><div>We acknowledge that the crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection served to uplift faith to understand eternal Life, even the allness of Soul, Spirit, and the nothingness of matter.
</div><div>And we solemnly promise to watch, and pray for that Mind to be in us which was also in Christ Jesus; to do unto others as we would have them do unto us; and to be merciful, just, and pure.
